Tapta challenges for open debate about the ban of the film “Keishal Jail“. He was a producer as well as a playback singer in the said movie.
As he was not a member of AMMIK (All Manipur Matam Eshei Kanglup), his movie was prohibited from screening in cinema halls.

We have two film review boards in Manipur, one is Film Forum and the another one is AMMIK. Tapta criticized that AMMIK was founded in 2002 with the sole purpose to destroy his singing career, so he would never be a part of the said organisation.
