So many singers have been born, and so many have passed. But some old ones still exist in their music.

Till now, we are still enchanted by the melodious tunes and lyrics written and recorded by many famous singers. Some of them are named as Legends. "Tapta" is also  considered as a living revolutionary legendary singer of Manipur and his legacy will last many generations.

Tapta has recorded hundreds of songs since 1990s. And hence, the followers are also very large considering other singers of Manipur. His straightforward and thought provoking lyrics have mesmerized so many people from children to middle-aged persons. Even though most of his songs particularly *the power of attraction volumes* are considered as sexual, he is the only political singer who can sing courageously about our dirty social practises like bandhs, corruptions, drinking/bad-eating habits, etc. He tried to bring a revolution and to bring mass awareness of our social dirty politics and practises through his lyrics in either straightforward or satirical way. That's why he is also considered as a revolutionary singer, and a Legend.

## Albums and its Classification
Unlike other singers of Manipur, Tapta tends to release most of his songs as albums. His first album was *the power of attraction volume 01* in 1995, and he has recorded and released many other albums since then. His albums are named as the power of attraction, series, prucks and special attraction. Let's see how it is classified.

### Albums
* **Volumes** : Social Issues (Power of Attractions)
* **Series** : Romantic Songs
* **Prucks** : Nationalism, Social and Revolutionary Songs 
* **Special Attraction**:  Songs dealt with a special problem/situation of Manipur
* **Group Voice** : Introducing new talents

## Introducing ["taptalyrics"](https://taptalyrics.wordpress.com) blog
As a big fan of Tapta, my brother Sumanta and I wanted to introduce a blog of Tapta, only for his song lyrics. Considering the popularity of Tapta, we thought introducing a lyrics blog would help a lot of lyrics-confused listeners as well as it would help a lot of listeners to enjoy the songs of Tapta. _That's the reason behind the launching of a new Tapta blog,_ [_taptalyrics.wordpress.com_](https://taptalyrics.wordpress.com). 

As time passed, we were also evolved, so our blog "taptalyrics" is. We wanted to provide Mp3s as well associated with its lyrics, and hence all the songs available in mp3s were uploaded in Dropbox and Google Drive and the links were shared in public for download. If anybody finds any problem in downloading or broken links, contact me via email, or through our [facebook page](https://facebook.com/taptasongs). And you can also enjoy the first experience of latest singles or albums released in our blog.
