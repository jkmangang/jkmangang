My 2+ year old Oneplus One is still working good. The camera disappointed me a little bit as the camera blobs are no longer updated since Marshmallow, and I'm running LineageOs as the primary Os in my phone, to upgrade in Android Nougat. I don't have a computer but I always tend to do things that I should do in a computer, with my  phone. Here are some android apps I love to mention and tricks that I use a lot. 

## Apps
#### [Chrome](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android.chrome)
Chrome is my most favourite browser for things I do in online. It is fast and secure. It is also a good replacement for the data and battery hog *Facebook* app. You can even download videos you see in facebook using Chrome.

#### [iA](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.ia.iawriter) 
iA is an app for writers. You can write articles or make notes using this app. It supports Markdown, so you can write whatever you like in markdown. It can convert your notes/articles in HTML also. You can connect it with your medium or wordpress account to publish directly from the app. Even I used this app to write this article too.

#### [Google Docs](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.docs.editors.docs)
If you wish to write an article or an assignment with your friends, Google Doc is your friend. Google Docs is quite good for notes you want to save in cloud and for collab writing.

#### [Snapseed](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.niksoftware.snapseed)
Editing has been made easier in Snapseed, another app owned by Google. It has some quite powerful tools like curves, double exposure, tonal contrast, grunge, etc.  You should read the **insights** provided in the lower portion of the app. It will teach you a lot of things also.

#### [Lightroom](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adobe.lrmobile)
Another powerful photo editing app provided by Adobe. 

#### [Google Drive](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.docs)
A place to keep every stuff you want to put in cloud. With its 15Gb storage, it is more than enough for me to save things I want to see it anytime. You can see the things you put there in anywhere using a browser in a phone or a computer. You can also share you stuffs using a manually generated URL.

#### [Dropbox](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dropbox.android)
Another personal cloud storage app to save things in cloud. But it provides you much lesser storage than Gdrive.

#### [Google Photos](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.photos)
Every photo I captured is stores in Google photos. Search tool inside the app is quite capable to search things like cars, keys, cats, flowers, and even marriage, concerts etc. It will save the photo in high quality, but if you want to save in its original quality, it occupies space of your Gdrive. 

#### [ttorent](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hu.tagsoft.ttorrent.lite)
A powerful and capable torrent client of Android. Pro version is more powerful, but the lite version is also quite capable. 

#### [Inbox](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.inbox)
It is a Gmail replacement app. It is colourful, provides rich previews of links. It manage your mails quite nice in bundles.

#### [Solid Xplorer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.solidexplorer2)
A beautiful material designed file manager app for android. Its two panes are quite useful. Batch renaming, ftp connection are some features included in this app. Besides, it has its own music player also inside the app.

#### [UC Browser](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.UCMobile.intl)
Want to download stuffs from online and also see lesser ads in webpages..?
It is the right browser for you and it uses lesser data too.

#### [Ampere](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gombosdev.ampere)
Sometimes, you may find charging to be very long and you want to figure out how much charging current the battery is taking / or how much current is coming through your usb cable. Ampere is there for you. I find it quite useful in adjusting my USB cable in a way to charge in normal rate. 


## Tricks
#### Things you can do in Github
Make a repository in Github. And copy the link of the file and add this suffix without the colons "*?raw=true*". The resultant link is the direct link for the file you upload in your repository. 

You can even make an static site like this one you are reading using Github pages. Google about it to learn more. 

#### Create Direct links for files in Gdrive
Get the sharable link of the file from Gdrive and then change the link as follows.

Example.
Sharable link : https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6O6v47Pfb4mVVBUeVp3ZXB6em8/view?usp=drivesdk
Direct link : https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=0B6O6v47Pfb4mVVBUeVp3ZXB6em8

Can you notice the difference? 

#### Get High Quality YouTube Thumbnail
Get the YouTube video id. 
And modify and insert in the below link.
